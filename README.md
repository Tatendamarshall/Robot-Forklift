# Robot-Forklift
A robot forklift with cameras, object detection and collision detection. 

PySerial library to communicate with the microcontroller or controller that controls the motors and other actuators of the forklift. The PyRobot library is used to control the forklift, which provides an easy-to-use interface for controlling robots, including forklifts.
OpenCV library is used for image processing and computer vision capabilities. It detects edges in the image, finds contours, and calculates the distance from the centroid of the contour to the forklift.
The 'winsound' library is used to play the warning beep sound when the distance is less than the collision distance threshold.
